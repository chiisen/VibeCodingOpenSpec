## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: One Page Overview Plan
The project MUST define a single-page overview structure for OpenSpec that documents hero messaging, why-to-use points, workflow summary, onboarding steps, CLI references, example folders, and community links in Traditional Chinese with supporting English keywords.

#### Scenario: Sections enumerated
- WHEN the change is approved
- THEN the blueprint lists the required sections in the documented order (Hero, Why OpenSpec, Workflow, Getting Started, CLI Quick Reference, Example Change Folder, Community and Updates)
- AND each section includes the key talking points sourced from the upstream OpenSpec README.

#### Scenario: Bilingual terminology aligned
- WHEN drafting copy for the page
- THEN Traditional Chinese messaging is provided as the primary text
- AND core English terms such as "Spec-driven development" and "Change Proposal" are preserved alongside the Chinese descriptions.
